## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house.
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.
- Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
Findings based on above model is that :-

 Based on the extracted list of 15 varialbles from Lasso and Ridge Some of the variables that impact the price of house are :-

- GrLivArea
- OverallQual_9
- OverallCond_9
- OverallQual_8
- Neighbourhood_Crawfor
- Functional_Typ
- Exterior1st_BrkFace
- SaleCondition_Alloca
- CentralAir_Y
- TotalBsmtSF
- Neighborhood_Somerst

Value of lambda for Ridge Regression = 9.0
Value of lambda for Lasso Regression = 0.001
